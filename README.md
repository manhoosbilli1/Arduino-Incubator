# Arduino-Incubator
Full information about the arduino incubator in which i will upload all the libraries, all the documentation and details about the project.

<----------------------------------------------LIBRARIES----------------------------->

Bounce2 (only used in working motor sketch): https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2
LCD library (only i2c, if its not i2c use the standard one. will work the same): added in main page as a folder 
JC button library (used in main sketch, and i suggest using this one):https://github.com/JChristensen/JC_Button
DHT LIB (im using a generic one but you can use the adafruit one. its an easy sketch i will explain in one of my videos: https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
RTC library: https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib

The rest of the libraries are already included in arduino's IDE


<----------------Things needed for this proejct--------------->
1- LCD (16x2 if you want to copy paste this code. you can go with 20x4 but you will have to change initial statements comment on youtube    channel and ill try to help)
2- 3 buttons
3- arduino nano (or any other board you prefer)
4- buzzer
5- RTC (optional)
6- 2 Fans
7- a light bulb 60 Watts should be enough
8- 2 limit switches
9- one very slow motor (anything under 10rpm)

<--------------This is where all the code lives--------------->

You are free to use this code and modify it however you like but you have to mention my name and link to this repository and my youtube channel in other words don't ommit the first comment section in the sketches
